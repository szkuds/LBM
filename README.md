# LBM Code Base

## Description
This is an LBM framework developed to efficiently run different simulations. The main goal is to set up an environment which can be understood by people who do not have a lot of coding experience.

## Features
- Incorporates sophisticated models to improve simulation accuracy
- Supports different models for various simulation needs
- Designed for ease of use, especially for those with limited coding experience

## Prerequisites
The project has been developed on a silicon-based Mac. Specific system requirements are not fully determined at this time.

## Installation
To install the project, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/szkuds/LBM.git
```

## Usage
To run a simulation:

1. Navigate to the project directory, 
2. Run the desired simulation file in the terminal:

```bash
python simulation_file.py
```

## Configuration
Currently, there are no specific configuration options that users need to be aware of.
